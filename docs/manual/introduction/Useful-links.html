			If you find something that you'd like to add here, or think that one of the links below is no longer
			relevant or working, feel free to click the 'edit' button in the top right and make some changes!<br /><br />

			Note also that as three.js is under rapid development, a lot of these links will contain information that is
			out of date - if something isn't working as you'd expect or as one of these links says it should,
			check the browser console for warnings or errors, the relevant docs pages and especially the [page:DeprecatedList].<br /><br />

			In addition to this page, mrdoob maintains a collection of links related to three.js over on Google+.
			Check them out <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ThreejsOrg">here</a>.

		<h2>Help forums</h2>
		<div>
			Three.js officially uses [link:http://stackoverflow.com/tags/three.js/info Stack Overflow] for help requests.
			If you need assistance with something, that's the place to go. Do NOT open an issue on Github for help requests.
