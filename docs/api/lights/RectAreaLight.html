		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<div class="desc">
			This light gets emitted uniformly across the face a rectangular plane. This can be
			used to simulate things like bright windows or strip lighting.<br /><br />

			This light can cast shadows - see the [page:RectAreaLightShadow] page for details.<br /><br />

			<em>NOTE:</em> this class is currently under active development and is probably not
			production ready yet (as of r83). Check back in a month or two! And feel free to try it out in the meantime.
		</div>




		<h2>Examples</h2>

		<div>
			[example:webgl_lights_arealight WebGL / arealight ]<br />
			[example:webgl_lights_rectarealight WebGL / rectarealight ]

			<code>
var width = 2;
var height = 10;
var rectLight = new THREE.RectAreaLight( 0xffffff, undefined,  width, height );
rectLight.matrixAutoUpdate = true;
rectLight.intensity = 70.0;
rectLight.position.set( 5, 5, 0 );
rectLightHelper = new THREE.RectAreaLightHelper( rectLight );
rectLight.add( rectLightHelper );

scene.add(rectLight)
			</code>
		</div>





		<h2>Constructor</h2>


		<h3>[name]( [page:Integer color], [page:Float intensity], [page:Float distance], [page:Radians angle], [page:Float penumbra], [page:Float decay] )</h3>
		<div>
			[page:Integer color] - (optional) hexadecimal color of the light. Default is 0xffffff (white).<br />
			[page:Float intensity] - (optional) numeric value of the light's strength/intensity. Default is 1.<br /><br />
			[page:Float width] - (optional) width of the light. Default is 10.<br />
			[page:Float height] - (optional) height of the light. Default is 10.

			Creates a new [name].
		</div>

		<h2>Properties</h2>
		<div>
			See the base [page:Light Light] class for common properties.
		</div>


		<h3>[property:Boolean castShadow]</h3>
		<div>
			If set to *true* light will cast dynamic shadows. *Warning*: This is expensive and
			requires tweaking to get shadows looking right. See the [page:RectAreaLightShadow] for details.
			The default is *false*.<br /><br />

			<em>Note:</em> this is not yet implemented for this light type! (r83)
		</div>

		<h3>[property:Float decay]</h3>
		<div>
			The amount the light dims along the distance of the light.<br />
			In [page:WebGLRenderer.physicallyCorrectLights physically correct] mode, decay = 2 leads to
			physically realistic light falloff. The default is *1*.<br /><br />

			<em>Note:</em> this is not yet implemented for this light type! (r83)
		</div>

		<h3>[property:Float distance]</h3>
		<div>
			If non-zero, light will attenuate linearly from maximum intensity at the light's
			position down to zero at this distance from the light. Default is *0.0*.<br /><br />

			<em>Note:</em> this is not yet implemented for this light type! (r83)
		</div>

		<h3>[property:Boolean isRectAreaLight]</h3>
		<div>
			Used to check whether this or derived classes are spot lights. Default is *true*.<br /><br />

			You should not change this, as it used internally for optimisation.
		</div>

		<h3>[property:Vector3 position]</h3>
		<div>
			This is set equal to [page:Object3D.DefaultUp] (0, 1, 0), so that the light shines from the top down.
		</div>

		<h3>[property:RectAreaLightShadow shadow]</h3>
		<div>
			A [page:RectAreaLightShadow] used to calculate shadows for this light.<br /><br />

			<em>Note:</em> this is not yet implemented for this light type! (r83)
		</div>


		<h3>[property:Object3D target]</h3>
		<div>
			The RectAreaLight points from its [page:.position position] to target.position. The default
			position of the target is *(0, 0, 0)*.<br />

			*Note*: For the the target's position to be changed to anything other than the default,
			it must be added to the [page:Scene scene] using
			<code>
				scene.add( light.target );
			</code>

			This is so that the target's [page:Object3D.matrixWorld matrixWorld] gets automatically
			updated each frame.<br /><br />

			It is also possible to set the target to be another object in the scene (anything with a
			[page:Object3D.position position] property), like so:
			<code>
var targetObject = new THREE.Object3D();
scene.add(targetObject);

light.target = targetObject;
			</code>
			The RectAreaLight will now track the target object.
		</div>


		<h2>Methods</h2>
		<div>
			See the base [page:Light Light] class for common methods.
		</div>


		<h3>[method:RectAreaLight copy]( [page:RectAreaLight source] )</h3>
		<div>
		Copies value of all the properties from the [page:RectAreaLight source] to this
		RectAreaLight.
